        Introductions / Task 1
    </h3>

   <p>

        You have
        been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
        One of you will be selected at random to be participant A;
        the other will be participant B.
        You will learn whether you are participant A or B prior to making any
        decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        To start, participant A receives {{ Constants.endowment }};
        participant B receives
        nothing.
        Participant A can send some or all of
        their endowment to participant B.
        Before B receives this amount, it will be multiplied
        by {{ Constants.multiplier }}. Once informed of the amount sent to them,
        B can decide to offer some, or all of it to A.
        participant A must then accept or deny B's offer.
        you will perform this task for 5 rounds, and will be paired up randomly each time. If A accepts, A receives
        whatever B sent them, along with the remainder of whatever was not sent (if any). If A accepts, B receives
        whatever was sent to them minus what they sent to A.
        If the offer is rejected, A keeps the remainder, and B receives 0.
    </p>
    <p>
        Suppose participant A sends 40 of their 100 points to B, leaving 60 as a remainder.
        This amount will then be tripled by the computer and B will receive 120 points.
        Suppose B offers 50 points back to A. If A accepts the offer, B will end with 70 points, and A will end with
        110 points. If A rejects this offer, B will end with 0 points, while A will keep their remainder of 60 points.
    You will be asked to complete this task 5 times. You will be randomly paired each time. There is no
        guarantee that you will be paired with the same person again.
    </p>
    <P>
        After the experiment is finished, you will asked to complete a short questionnaire.
         As a thank you for completing this experiment
    you will be put in a draw to randomly win a prize.
    </P>
