        Instructions/Task 1
    </h3>
    <p>
        You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
        One of you will be selected at random to be participant A;
        the other will be participant B.
        You will learn whether you are participant A or B prior to making any
        decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        To start, participant A receives {{ Constants.endowment }};
        participant B receives
        nothing.
        Participant A can send some or all of
        their {{ Constants.endowment }} to participant B.
        Before B receives this amount, it will be multiplied
        by {{ Constants.multiplier }}. Once informed of the amount sent to them,
        B can decide to send some, or all of it to back to A. You will be asked to complete this task 5 times.
        You will be randomly paired each time. There is no
        guarantee that you will be paired with the same person again.
    </p>

        <P>
            After the experiment is finished, you will asked to complete a short questionnaire.
         As a thank you for completing this experiment
    you will be put in a draw to randomly win a prize.
